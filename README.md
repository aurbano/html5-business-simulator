HTML5 & Vanilla JS Business Sims
=========

Some work I did a while ago for a client, they contain simple business simulators built on HTML5 + vanilla JavaScript. The text is in Spanish.

From a technical point of view they are animated scenes all done using JavaScript without any framework. If I had to work on this again I'd probably first develop a simple "presentation" engine that would handle the logic
The code in the second & third available simulators is a lot cleaner, as I learned from several mistakes while developing the first.

They were not built specifically for code maintainability or reusability, so they are slighly messier than I'd like.

The two that are available here are:

* [Plant growing simulator](https://urbanoalvarez.es/html5-business-simulator/)
* [Culture development simulator](https://urbanoalvarez.es/html5-business-simulator/simulador2.html)
* [Business management simulator](https://urbanoalvarez.es/html5-business-simulator/simulador3.html)
