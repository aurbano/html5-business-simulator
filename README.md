HTML5 & Vanilla JS Business Sims
=========

Some work I did a while ago for a client, they contain simple business simulators built on HTML5 + vanilla JavaScript. The text is in Spanish.

From a technical point of view they are animated scenes all done using JavaScript without any framework. If I had to work on this again I'd probably first develop a simple "presentation" engine that would handle the logic
The code in the second & third available simulators is a lot cleaner, as I learned from several mistakes while developing the first.

They were not built specifically for code maintainability or reusability, so they are slighly messier than I'd like.

Simulators:
