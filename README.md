HTML5 & Vanilla JS Business Sims
=========

Some work I did a while ago for a client, they contain simple business simulators built on HTML5 + vanilla JavaScript. The text is in Spanish.

They were not built specifically for code maintainability or reusability, so they are slighly messier than I'd like.
